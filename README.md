# About Me:
I'm currently studying for a Bachelor's degree in Systems at ORT University. I work in the cloud infrastructure sector at INCO Soluciones. I normally use Github for learning purposes, with future commitment to personal projects. I have knowledge of Java, JS, AWS, IBM Cloud, GCP, and C#. I have participated in web development and short- and medium-range applications.
